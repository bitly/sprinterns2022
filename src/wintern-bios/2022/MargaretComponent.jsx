      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>I am a 23 sophomore at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science. I recently moved to the city after transferring from Bryn Mawr College in PA. My first expereince with coding was the art-focused language of processing and ever since then I've been hooked! I love the trial and error process of coding and debugging, it's like solving a jigsaw puzzle. My dream job is to become a software engineer and I am thankful to every opportunity that brings me closer to this path. I am incredibly grateful to my family. 
        My parents had to sacrafice so much to provide for me and my siblings and as a first generation college student a goal of mine is to graduate, complete my masters, and buy my family a big house! I also would like to retire on a farm, foster pets and have a pet pig (they love to cuddle!)</p>
