                    <p className='first'> HI! Welcome to my Bio! </p>
                    <p> I am Lara Choudhury. I am 19 years old. I am an upper sophmore at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
                    Majoring in Computer Science and Information Security.</p>
                    <p> As well as studying computer science, I work in a family Real Estate Business with my parents.</p>
                    <p> I intend on getting my salespersons license within the next month. I love both computer science and real estate because 
                    I get to accomplish and learn so much from both careers.</p>
                    <p> I come from a diverse background where my mom is Puerto Rican and my dad is Indian. 
                    I speak fluent spanish because I grew up in Lares, Puerto Rico with my grandparents.</p>
                    <p> I have two sisters one is five years old and the other is thirteen. I love them both a lot.</p>
                    <p> My favorite things to do in my free time are just to spend time with my family. I love shopping and driving
                    everywhere. </p>
                    <p> As I get older, my dreams are to either follow a career in engineering, most likely as a front end enginner because I love
                    seeing when my work comes together and I would love to become a real estate Broker and take over my families business. </p>
