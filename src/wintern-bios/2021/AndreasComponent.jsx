      <p>About Me: I am 21-years-old. I am a Junior in CUNY Hunter College. My major is English, concentrated on Creative Writing; minor in Computer Science. Fun Fact: I have plenty! I am the third oldest of 7 kids. I have a 5-year-old cat named Khloe! I know two other languages (Spanish, and Japanese).</p>

      <p>Things I Like: I like to write! I am currently writing an epic that I've planned out for many years. It is currently being revised, and will continue to be revised until I have written every idea out (it may take a while). I also like to play softcore and relaxing games such as Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and Minecraft!</p>
      
      <p>When I Grow Up: It's a real toss-up! I am still adamant about completeing my story in the near future, however I find myself looking at other directions about my future career goals. I want to be a writer but I also want to start streaming and have discussions about my story or aspects of what a story can be. Then there is also the idea to be a web developer or to help facilitate programs for web developement in classrooms like Code Nation! There are so many directions that I want to take, honestly!</p>
